Caffeine Tracker
================

Caffeine tracking webapp. Still very much a work in progress; end goal is to have users enter times of day caffeine was consumed and in what quantity, and be able to output approximate caffeine concentration in their blood.

Based upon previous modeling work done by Kristyn Walker and Dakota Nelson at Olin College of Engineering.
